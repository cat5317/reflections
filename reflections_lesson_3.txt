When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository would be useful when you are sharing your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You have more control and can choose exactly when it is important to commit. That way
you don't have too many commits or commits that don't make sense.
