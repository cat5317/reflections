When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- A remote repository would be useful when you are sharing your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You have more control and can choose exactly when it is important to commit. That way
you don't have too many commits or commits that don't make sense.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
would you use one instead of another?
- Forks are for cloning and editing other people's projects off of GitHub.
Cloning is copying someone else's project from GitHub, but doesn't automatically create
a remote to GitHub. Branching is done locally, if you are changing various
components of a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
- So you can work on it off line 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- It would be very difficult to share and compare changes with other people working on the same project.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
- Changes should be made in a branch if you are testing out experimental features or if you are 
working on a project with other people and want to share a change nefore makig it permanent.
